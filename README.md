# GoT---Next-Word-Prediction
In this repository, I have worked on Next Word prediction project on Game of thrones book dataset

## **ðŸ§¾Description:**
This is a classic Text Generation problem, using scriptures of famous books, Game of Thrones in this case. Open-ended language models are trending research in this era which gives rise to deep learning models with distinct architecture. In this problem, we have the first couple of chapters from the Classic Game Of Thrones Book. Generating text on this corpus would lead to an advancement in AI fictional corpus generation.

## **ðŸ§­ Problem Statement:**
You are provided with `got1:` you have to perform a step-by-step NLP approach to generate text based on input from any part of the book. Reference to performing the task has been attached below.

## **Steps to perform for building text generation model**

1. Loading dataset 
2. Data preparation
3. Tokenization and vectorization
4. Building deep learning model to predict next word from the sequences
5. Model training with 50 epochs
6. Saving model in H5 format
